    <P>I/O classes.

    <h2>Package Specification</h2>

	<p>Classes in this package fulfill needs that are not satisfied by the
	I/O classes available.

	<h3>Reading text</h3>
	
	<p>We provide replacement classes such as {@link
	it.unimi.dsi.io.FastBufferedReader} and classes exposing the lines of
	a file as an {@linkplain
	it.unimi.dsi.io.FileLinesMutableStringIterable Iterable}. The general
	{@link it.unimi.dsi.io.WordReader} interface is used by <a
	href="http://mg4j.dsi.unimi.it/">MG4J</a> to provide customisable word
	segmentation.

	<h3>Bit-level I/O</h3>
	
    <P>The standard Java API lacks bit-level I/O classes: to this purpose, we
    provide {@link it.unimi.dsi.io.InputBitStream} and {@link
    it.unimi.dsi.io.OutputBitStream}, which can wrap any standard Java
    corresponding stream and make it work at the bit level; moreover, they
    provide support for several useful formats (such as unary, binary, minimal
    binary, &gamma;, &delta; and Golomb encoding).

    <P>Bit input and output streams offer also efficient buffering and a way to
    reposition the bit stream in case the underlying byte stream is a
    file-based stream or a {@link it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.io.RepositionableStream}.

    <h2>Conventions</h2>
    
    <p><strong>All coding methods work on natural numbers</strong>. The
    encoding of zero is very natural for some techniques, and much less natural
    for others. To keep methods rationally organised, all methods are able to
    encode any natural number. If, for instance, you want to write positive
    numbers in unary encoding and you do not want to waste a bit, you have to
    decrement them first (i.e., instead of <var>p</var> you must encode
    <var>p</var>&minus;1).
