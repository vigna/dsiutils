/** An interface providing methods to break the input from a reader into words.
 *
 * <p>The intended implementations of this interface should decorate
 * a given reader (see, for instance, {@link FastBufferedReader}).
 * The reader can be changed at any time using {@link #setReader(Reader)}.
 *
 * <p>This interface is heavily oriented towards reusability and
 * streaming. It is conceived so that at most one method call has
 * to be performed per <em>word</em>, rather than per <em>character</em>,
 * and that implementations may completely avoid object creation by
 * {@linkplain #setReader(Reader) setting explicitly the underlying reader}.
 *
 * <p>The standard implementation ({@link FastBufferedReader}) breaks
 * words in the trivial way. More complex implementations (e.g., for languages requiring
 * segmentation) can subclass {@link FastBufferedReader} or provide their
 * own implementation.
