/**
 * A set of coherent methods to turn element-type, attribute and entity names to unique interned
 * instances.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link BulletParser} needs a way to turn a name (for an element type,
 * attribute, or entity) into a corresponding object of type {@link Element},
 * {@link Attribute} or {@link Entity}, respectively. The
 * returned element must be an interned, unique representation.
 *
 * <P>
 * For instance, the {@linkplain HTMLFactory standard factory for HTML} parsing
 * has ready-made interned versions of all names in the (X)HTML specification, and returns them upon
 * request, but other policies are possible. For instance, instances of {@link WellFormedXmlFactory}
 * intern every seen name, without reference to a data type (except for entities, in which case the
 * HTML set is used).
 *
 * <P>
 * The idea of factoring out the creation of interned counterparts of SGML/XML syntactical objects
 * is due to Fabien Campagne.
