/**
 * A vector of bits, a&#46;k&#46;a&#46; bit sequence, bit string, binary word, etc.
 *
 * <P>
 * This interface define several operations on finite sequences of bits. Efficient implementations,
 * such as {@link LongArrayBitVector}, use approximately one bit of memory for each bit in the
 * vector, but this is not enforced.
 *
 * <P>
 * Operation of a bit vector are partially of boolean nature (e.g., logical operations between
 * vectors), partially of language-theoretical nature (e.g., concatenation), and partially of
 * set-theoretical nature (e.g., asking which bits are set to one). To accomodate all these points
 * of view, this interface extends {@link BooleanBigList}, but also
 * provides an {@link #asLongSet()} method that exposes a {@link java.util.BitSet}-like view and a
 * {@link #asLongBigList(int)} method that provides integer-like access to blocks of bits of given
 * width.
 *
 * <P>
 * Most, if not all, classical operations on bit vectors can be seen as standard operations on these
 * two views: for instance, the number of bits set to one is just the number of elements of the set
 * returned by {@link #asLongSet()} (albeit a direct {@link #count()} method is provided, too). The
 * standard {@link java.util.Collection#addAll(java.util.Collection)} method can be used to
 * concatenate bit vectors, and
 * {@linkplain BooleanBigList#subList(long, long) sublist views} make
 * it easy performing any kind of logical operation on subvectors.
 *
 * <P>
 * The only <i>caveat</i> is that sometimes the standard interface naming clashes slightly with
 * standard usage: for instance, {@link #clear()} will <em>not</em> set to zero all bits (use
 * {@link #fill(int) fill(0)} for that purpose), but rather will set the vector length to zero.
 * Also, {@link #add(long, int)} will not add logically a value at the specified index, but rather
 * will insert a new bit with the specified value at the specified position.
 *
 * <P>
 * To increase clarity, this interface provides methods {@link #length()} and {@link #length(long)}
 * which have a semantics similar to {@link #size64()} and {@link #size(long)}.
 *
 * <P>
 * The {@link AbstractBitVector} class provides a fairly complete abstract implementation that
 * provides all methods except for the most basic operations. Of course, the methods of
 * {@link AbstractBitVector} are sometimes very inefficient, but implementations such as
 * {@link LongArrayBitVector} have their own optimised implementations.
